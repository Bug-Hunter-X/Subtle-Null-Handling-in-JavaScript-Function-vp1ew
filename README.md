# Subtle Null Handling Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null handling in a simple JavaScript function. The function `foo` adds two numbers, but its handling of null values might not be robust enough to account for other falsy values like 0 or empty strings.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering how your code handles different input types and edge cases.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function correctly handles `null` inputs by returning 0. However, it doesn't explicitly handle other falsy values that might unintentionally lead to unexpected results.  The solution enhances the code to be more robust and clear. 

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code using Node.js or a similar JavaScript runtime. 
4. Observe the output. The code appears correct, but there is room for improvement. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a refined version of the function, handling falsy values in a more explicit manner.
